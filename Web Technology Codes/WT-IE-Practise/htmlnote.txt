hello this my note for html for practice sessions.

*Practice session Asar 16, 2078BS, Thursday*

Span tag:
Span tag is a inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of document. 
The <span> tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using class or Id attribute.
The <span> yag is much like <div> element, but <div> is a block-level element and <span> is an inline element. 

Block and Inline Elements:
Every html element has a default display value, depending upon what type of element it is. There are two display values: block and inline.
A block-level element always starts on a new line. 
A block-level element always takes up the full width available (streches out to the left and right as far as it can)
A block-level element has a top and a bottom margin, whereas an inline element doesnot.


HTML Attributes:
All HTML elements can have attributes.
Attributes provides additional information about elements.
Attributes are always specified in the start tag.
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value".

HTML Styles:
The html style attribute us used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.
<tagnmae style="property:value;">
<p style="color:red;">
The property is a CSS property. The vaue is a CSS value.

HTML text formatting:
<big>This is Big.</big>
<mark>This is a marked text.</mark>
<del>What is a deleted text.</del>
<em>This must be emphasized.</em>
<hr>
<ins>Inserted text</ins>
